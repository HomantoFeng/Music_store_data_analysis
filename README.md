# Music_store_data_analysis

In this project, I wrote five SQL queries to analyze the intricate relationships among 12 datasets from the Music Store Data Analysis. I also developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to visually represent the table structures and their logical interconnections. By combining these SQL queries with the ER model, I demonstrate my ability to handle complex datasets, extract meaningful insights, and present results in a clear and organized way.

SQL queries to answer five questions:
-- Find info of all Rock Music listeners returning emails, first name and last name
-- List top 10 artist name and total track counts of the top 10 rock bands
-- Find all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length
-- Find out the most popular music genre for each country
-- Find out the customer that spent the most for each country
